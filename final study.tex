\paragraph{Euler's Formula.} (Proved in class by induction) This formula stats that the sum of number of vertices $|V|$ and the number of faces $|F|$ subtracted by the number  of edges $|E|$ is equal to 2.  $$|V|-|E|+|F| = 2$$

\paragraph{Catalan's number.} Catalan's number is a number in the sequence define by 
\[
C_n = \binom{2n}{n} - \binom{2n}{n-1} = \frac{1}{n+1}\binom{2n}{n} =  \frac{(2n)!}{n! (n+1)!}
\]
It is often interpreted as the number of shortest grid walks on or above the diagonal of a $n \times n$ grid.
\paragraph{Hand Shake Lemma}
\paragraph{Trees and stuff} 
\subparagraph{A Tree} is a graph that is connected but contains no cycle.


If $T = (V,E)$ is a tree, then:
\begin{enumerate} 
\item $T$ is bipartite. Why? Wecause $G(V,E)$ is bipartite iff there is no odd cycle.\\
Tree does not contain cycles  $\rightarrow$ no odd cycles $\rightarrow$ bipartite.
\item (proved by induction):  $|V| = |E| + 1$
\item there exist at least two vertices $v, w$ such that $\{v, w | deg(v) = deg(w) = 1\}$
\end{enumerate}


\paragraph{Cayley's formula} Number of spanning trees in $K_n = n^{n-2}$
\subparagraph{Ex:} What is the probability of random n-1 edges chosen from $K_n$ forming a spanning tree in $K_n$? 
\[
\frac{n^{n-2}}{\binom{\binom{n}{2}}{n-1}}
\]
